  /* Flat, not dotted. "light" and "dark" name the surface a component was
     designed against, and their colour is absolute rather than a theme token,
     which makes them the values to declare for a screenshot baseline. Use
     "dots" for the grid. */
  /* These two also re-point --prism-measure. Other overlays use theme colours
     on theme surfaces, but these grounds ignore the theme: "light" stays
     near-white in the dark theme and "dark" stays near-black in the light one.
     The dark theme's magenta reaches only 2.85:1 on the light ground, under the
     4.5:1 its 9px readout needs, so the measurement colour has to follow the
     ground, not the theme.

     --prism-measure-plate follows it for the same reason. It is the surface
     the measuring tool's value label paints itself on, so the label reads as a
     gap in the measurement line rather than a badge on top of it. At its
     --prism-stage fallback it would be the theme's stage under a re-pointed
     foreground: the light theme's magenta on the dark theme's stage reads
     3.71:1, the dark theme's on white 3.08:1. Pinned to the ground the same way,
     the pairs reach 4.54:1 and 6.57:1. A color-mix against the ground would
     work too, but this file already states both grounds literally, and one
     mechanism per decision is enough.

     Literal values because this file is theme-independent, like the two
     grounds below. Keep them in step with --prism-measure in canvas-overlay-tokens.ts and
     prism-default-theme.ts; semantic-colours.spec.ts fails if they drift. */
