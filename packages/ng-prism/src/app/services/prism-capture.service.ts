 * and only gets the space back once its siblings leave layout.

/**
 * Global stylesheet applied in capture mode.
 *
 * Document-level because emulated encapsulation would stop a renderer rule from
 * reaching the dynamically created showcase component's transitions and
 * animations.
 *
 * `background-image` is stripped because the dot/checker pattern's phase shifts
 * whenever the centred component resizes; the declared colour is deterministic
 * and stays. `!important` is required to beat the component-scoped stage rules.
 * `transparent` also drops the colour, across the layers in
 * {@link CAPTURE_TRANSPARENT_SELECTOR}; alpha is per-pixel and does not shift.
 * The rules from {@link CAPTURE_CANVAS_ONLY_SELECTOR} down give the canvas the
 * whole viewport, so the background covers the capture target's whole box.
 *
 * The stage padding goes too. The stage is `height: 100%` under `content-box`,
 * so the padding makes it 64px taller than its row and centres the component
 * 32px too low. Without it the stage is the canvas, and a component is
 * contained iff it fits the viewport.
 *
 * The stage edge is `outline` plus `box-shadow`, never a border, so it does not
 * move `.demo-wrap`'s centre and shift baselines. It still paints, and with the
 * padding gone it sits flush against the component, so capture mode removes the
 * paint and keeps the geometry. {@link CAPTURE_TRANSPARENT_SELECTOR} does not
 * cover this: an outline is not a background.
 *
 * A variant that forces pseudo states (`.demo-wrap[data-pseudo]`) gets 8px of
 * room around the component. `.demo-wrap` hugs the component's box, but a focus
 * ring is drawn outside it (an `outline` with an offset, a `box-shadow` halo),
 * so a screenshot of the bare box would crop it. The negative margin takes the
 * padding back out of layout, so the component sits and sizes exactly as
 * without it, and `content-box` keeps the padding outside a `stretch` variant's
 * width. That width gives up the room where the canvas is narrower than
 * `max-width` plus the room, so the room stays inside the canvas instead of
 * being clipped on one side and scrolling on the other; from there on
 * `max-width` clamps it to the width it has without the room. Only these
 * variants: any other change to `.demo-wrap`'s box would move every existing
 * baseline.
