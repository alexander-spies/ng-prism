 * the rulers and the stage's dot or checker pattern. axe works out the
 * stacking itself, so an overlay on top of the subject reads as covering its
 * text and a colour-contrast check comes back undecided ("bgOverlap"), as
 * does any text over a background image.
 *
 * Hidden are the siblings of `element` and of each of its ancestors up to the
 * stage, inline and restored afterwards: an overlay sits beside the subject in
 * `.demo-wrap` and measures itself against that parent, so it is not wrapped.
 * What the subject renders itself stays visible, a CDK overlay in `<body>`
 * included (axe audits the subject's subtree, so such an overlay is not
 * audited either way). Synchronous, so the hiding does not wait for change
 * detection, and undone however `run` ends. An element outside a canvas stage
 * is audited as it is.
