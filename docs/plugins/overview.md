# Plugin Overview

Plugins extend ng-prism with additional panels, controls, and build-time data extraction. They are registered in your `ng-prism.config.ts` and activated automatically during both the build pipeline and at runtime.

## What Plugins Can Do

| Capability           | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `panels`             | Add new tabs to the addon panel area (bottom / right) or the view toolbar                            |
| `controls`           | Register custom input controls for specific TypeScript types                                         |
| `wrapComponent`      | Wrap each rendered component with an Angular component (e.g. for context providers or overlay hosts) |
| `onComponentScanned` | Enrich `ScannedComponent` data at build time (e.g. extract JSDoc, inject external metadata)          |
| `onPageScanned`      | Enrich `StyleguidePage` data at build time                                                           |
| `onManifestReady`    | Transform the final manifest before it is written to disk                                            |

## Installing Plugins

The fastest path is the `ng-add` schematic. It installs the package and registers the plugin in `ng-prism.config.ts` automatically:

```bash
ng add @ng-prism/plugin-jsdoc
ng add @ng-prism/plugin-figma
# … and so on for any other plugin
```

Re-running is safe, because already-registered plugins are skipped.

If you prefer to wire things up manually, install the package and add the plugin factory to your config:

```typescript
// ng-prism.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@ng-prism/core';
import { jsDocPlugin } from '@ng-prism/plugin-jsdoc';
import { figmaPlugin } from '@ng-prism/plugin-figma';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [jsDocPlugin(), figmaPlugin()]
});
```

Plugins run in registration order during build-time hooks and are activated in order at runtime.
